## Problem

### Goal 1
Refactor the Polygon class so that all the calculated properties are lazy properties, i.e. they should still be calculated properties, but they should not have to get recalculated more than once (since we made our Polygon class "immutable").

### Goal 2
Refactor the Polygons (sequence) type, into an iterable. Make sure also that the elements in the iterator are computed lazily - i.e. you can no longer use a list as an underlying storage mechanism for your polygons.

You'll need to implement both an iterable, and an iterator.

## Solution 

### Goal 1
In order to implement lazy properties, all the `__init__()` variables are initialised as `None` and an if condition is placed which helps calculate the properties only when it is called. Print statements were placed to test lazy implementation. A companion jupyter notebook is attached to this repo to test this implementation.

### Goal 2
In order to implement iteration mechanisms `for`, `iter()` & `next`

* CustomPolygon class must contain `__iter__()` method that returns an iterator object. Supporting this method makes this class an *iterable*

* Each iterator has a `__next__()` method that returns the next item from the CustomPolygon class each time it is called. It raises `StopIteration` when there are no more items left. 

* In order to pass iterators to a `for` loop without an underlying list, the iterator is equiped with `__iter__()` method that simply returns itself.
